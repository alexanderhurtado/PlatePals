      <p>Set the scene, your at home and your significant other comes to you and says "where do you want to eat at tonight?".
         What do you do? this was the problem everytime when my significant other and I would try to decide on a
         place to dine at. what about this, what about that, it went on and on. in 2023, I was introduced to Nick who had this
         idea of an web app that would help you find a place to eat that both parties would enjoy. as soon as I heard that,
         on board.<p><br>
